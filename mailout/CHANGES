20011023	Added date for Date: header and for Received: header.

20011011	version became 0.13

20011011	add_recipient() gets the address from a
		To: name <address>.

		Added HOSTNAME compile-time definition.

		Reordered parts of read_and_save_message(), so
		CRLF would be added in between if no headers.
		(Noticed this bug when using qmail as hub, because it
		assumed a non-header line was a header because of the
		missing required blank line.)

20011010	Converted newlines to CRLF.

		Make sure CRLF is only added before last . if needed.
		(This fixed bug where usually an extra newline was sent.)

		Fixed problem where header was still set if not a header.
		(Introduced recently; but not noticed in usage.)

20011002	version became 0.12

20011002	Fixed problem (29/Mar/2001) where some headers were
		repeated. (message.c)

20010905	Got rid of setting address to all nulls in
		add_recipient, did this elsewhere.

		Fixed problem where multiple recipients on command-line
		didn't work; because argv pointer was being modified.

		Fixed problem where if "-t" was used, it would still
		add recipient from command-line.

20010423	Fixed error message if problem with message DATA
		(previously it said HELO).

		Send a Message-Id header if needed.

		Send a "Received:" header (this is not complete).

		Removed queue message and queue data files after delivery.

		Fixed getmailserver() so it would properly copy
		MAILHUB; it wasn't copying last character "\0"
		(mailout.c).

20010328	Ignore unknown options (instead of using them as
		addresses). This is a workaround fix so mailout
		works with cron
		(/usr/sbin/sendmail -FCronDaemon -odi -oem -oi -or0s -t).

20010216	Write to datafile one line at a time (instead of
		one character at a time).

		Check for single dot on a line and stop reading input.

		Moved add_recipient() out of mailout.c and created a
		new recipient.c file.

		Fixed realloc and malloc for add_recipient.

		Add "-oi" option; it is the same as "-i" option. (But
		this doesn't do anything yet.)

20001107	Add queue option, but it doesn't do anything yet.

		Add "--" option and now knows when in options or recipients.
