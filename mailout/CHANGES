mailout Changes/History

20030704	version became 0.17

		Bug fix: flock for queued message was done on
		wrong, uninitialized descriptor.

		When reporting errors on how remote SMTP server
		didn't respond with correct reply don't output
		non-related error message string too.

20030611	Bug fix: properly escape lines that start with
		a period by inserting another dot (message.c).

		version became 0.16

20021022	Skip recipient info in quotes; bug fix: don't
		assume names in quotes are email addresses when
		separated with a comma (message.c).

		Add newline in Received: header so it looks nicer
		(smtp.c).

		Updated man page for -oi and -i options (mailout.8).

		If -oi or -i switch is used, then a single dot on
		line is escaped by adding a second period -- so
		it doesn't terminate the SMTP DATA message 
		(message.c, smtp.c).

		Added -i and -oi option functionality. So now
		a dot on line by itself terminates incoming
		standard input (mailout.c, message.c).

		version became 0.15

20020710	version became 0.14

		Wrote manual page (mailout.8). Wrote README.

		Use flock with LOCK_EX instead of BSD's read(2)
		O_EXLOCK. Added sys/file.h include to message.c.

		Added time.h include to smtp.c.

		Make sure MAXBSIZE is defined (mailout.h).

		Added some function prototypes to mailout.h.

		Make sure strncpy'd strings are NUL terminated
		(mailout.c and recipient.c).

		Get rid of tmp_recipient -- not needed (mailout.c).

		Make sure realloc of recipients doesn't allocate
		size of zero first time (recipient.c).

20011219	Removed unnecessary memset in rcpt_to that blanked
		out the tmp buffer (smtp.c).

20011023	Set MAX_LINE_SIZE to 1000 and use it instead of lines of
		length 79.

		Ignore case when checking for headers; pine uses "cc:"
		internally when sending via "sendmail -t".

		Added date for Date: header and for Received: header.

20011011	version became 0.13

20011011	add_recipient() gets the address from a
		To: name <address>.

		Added HOSTNAME compile-time definition.

		Reordered parts of read_and_save_message(), so
		CRLF would be added in between if no headers.
		(Noticed this bug when using qmail as hub, because it
		assumed a non-header line was a header because of the
		missing required blank line.)

		Made a better Received header (but still in wrong function).

20011010	Converted newlines to CRLF.

		Make sure CRLF is only added before last . if needed.
		(This fixed bug where usually an extra newline was sent.)

		Fixed problem where header was still set if not a header.
		(Introduced recently; but not noticed in usage.)

20011002	version became 0.12

20011002	Fixed problem (29/Mar/2001) where some headers were
		repeated. (message.c)

20010905	Got rid of setting address to all nulls in
		add_recipient, did this elsewhere.

		Fixed problem where multiple recipients on command-line
		didn't work; because argv pointer was being modified.

		Fixed problem where if "-t" was used, it would still
		add recipient from command-line.

20010423	Fixed error message if problem with message DATA
		(previously it said HELO).

		Send a Message-Id header if needed.

		Send a "Received:" header (this is not complete).

		Removed queue message and queue data files after delivery.

		Fixed getmailserver() so it would properly copy
		MAILHUB; it wasn't copying last character "\0"
		(mailout.c).

20010328	Ignore unknown options (instead of using them as
		addresses). This is a workaround fix so mailout
		works with cron
		(/usr/sbin/sendmail -FCronDaemon -odi -oem -oi -or0s -t).

20010216	Write to datafile one line at a time (instead of
		one character at a time).

		Check for single dot on a line and stop reading input.

		Moved add_recipient() out of mailout.c and created a
		new recipient.c file.

		Fixed realloc and malloc for add_recipient.

		Add "-oi" option; it is the same as "-i" option. (But
		this doesn't do anything yet.)

20001107	Add queue option, but it doesn't do anything yet.

		Add "--" option and now knows when in options or recipients.
