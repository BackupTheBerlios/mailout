mailout

My plans and ideas:

- Send mail with a few "sendmail" options

 command-line options:
  -f from
  -- (no more options)

 -FCronDaemon -odi -oem -oi -or0s -t
                        /* -Fx   = set full-name of sender
                         * -odi  = Option Deliverymode Interactive
                         * -oem  = Option Errors Mailedtosender
                         * -or0s = Option Readtimeout -- don't time out
                         * -t    = read recipient from header of message

example:
"sendmail", "-i", "-t", "-F",
                    "\"Reminder Service\"", "-f", "root", NULL);


 -i, -oi: a  dot  on a line by itself should not
              terminate an incoming, non-SMTP message.

if option like "-f" is after a valid user name then Exim and Sendmail think
it is also a username to send to.

If no argument after option or bad argument:
sendmail -f
sendmail: option requires an argument -- f

/usr/sbin/exim -f
exim abandoned: unknown, malformed, or incomplete option -f

  - use /etc/aliases for forwarding mail
  - make sure it discards any root exec permissions
  - can deliver locally
    - use outside delivery program
  - can send out over network
  - can relay all mail through smarthost or mailhub
  - look for dns MX record for host; if not found, use A record
  - if can't send, then queue mail
    - no daemon to run queue, must run manually (i.e. via cron)
- Do not run as a daemon
- Do not listen to any ports (like 25 for example)

More thoughts:

- don't need setuid unless able to do local deliveries?

Do various checks.
use sm.c (raju) to benchmark

 ./mailout `perl -e 'printf "A" x 9777'`
 Exim says and logs:
  13rQzZ-0004mk-00 string_sprintf expansion was longer than 8192
 Sendmail acts weird, but says:
  Address too long
  prescan: token too long
 Qmail says after received input file:
  qmail-inject: fatal: envelope address too long for qq (#5.1.3)

 No command-line arguments:

 exim says "exim: neither action flags nor mail addresses given"
 qmail just reads input but doesn't do anything.
 sendmail says "jcr... Recipient names must be specified" then reads input
  and then doesn't do anything.

Don't assume remote SMTP server will behave.

MESSAGE ID
uniqueness of message id
The sendmail message id includes the pid.

from Philip Hazel on Exim list:
 I guarantee it, provided that (a) you don't ever set the clock backwards
 and (b) your operating system doesn't re-use a process ID within one
 second. The uniqueness depends on a combination of time and receiving 
 process id. Even if time goes backwards, or a process id is re-used 
 within one second, you would still need an Exim receiving process to get
 that same re-used id for there to be duplication.

---

As far as I can tell, sendmail copies standard input to the queue "df"
file before it even tries to make a smtp connection. This "df" file doesn't
have headers though.

Exim logs if press CTRL-C:
2000-11-09 10:34:03 SIGINT received while reading local message

If you abort/break with CTRL-C when entering data, sendmail doesn't cleanup,
the queue files still exist. Also if it runs out of disk space, it
doesn't clean up -- the queue files still exist.

/usr/home/jcr/testspool: write failed, file system is full

/usr/home/jcr/testspool: write failed, file system is full
collect: Cannot write tfOAA16717

/usr/home/jcr/testspool: write failed, file system is full

If you try to use regular sendmail and mqueue is read-only:
rainier:/var/spool$ echo "hello" | /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail reed@pilchuck
collect: Cannot write ./dff788Rwr21909 (bfcommit, uid=0): Read-only file system
queueup: cannot create queue temp file ./tff788Rwr21909, uid=0: Read-only file system

if "-t" and no usernames on command-line and none in headers
  Exim: mails message to user:

Subject: Mail failure - no recipient addresses

A message that you sent contained no recipient addresses, and so no
delivery could be attempted.

------ This is a copy of your message, including all the headers. ------

  sendmail: says "No recipient addresses found in header"
 
Exim acts the same if using "-t" option and a username is on command-line
but no recipients in headers.

But sendmail will use command-line usernames even with "-t" option if no
recipients in headers.


if header has space before colon, like
Subject : test
Exim and sendmail will turn into:
Subject: test

------

Philip Hazel:

 Exim works only with fully qualified RFC822 addresses, i.e. user@domain. 
 It does allow some incoming addresses not to have a domain, but it 
 always adds a domain as soon as it sees such addresses. The domain it 
 adds is set by qualify_recipient (which defaults to qualify_domain if 
 not explicitly set).

 There is no way round this. Internally, there is no provision for 
 handling local parts without a domain.
