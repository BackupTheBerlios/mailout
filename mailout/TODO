send-mail: mailout: remote smtp didn't like RCPT TO
send-mail: mailout: remote smtp didn't like DATA command
it shouldn't get to the DATA command if RCPT TO failed ...

(15/Oct/2003)
accept 251 for RCPT

(22/Jul/2003)
add config (run or build time) option to choose delivery agent
/usr/src/libexec/mail.local/mail.local.c is BSD licensed :)

(22/Jul/2003)
maybe use http://premk.sourceforge.net/
(autoconf alternative)

(04/Jul/2003)
the queue .d file has message-id without @host part
but created message id in real email is correct with @host part

(04/Jul/2003)
echo 456
made a queue file with:
^M
456^M
(it shouldn't have made a first line? maybe that was the header delimeter
so it is okay??)

(04/Jul/2003)
error messages should be logged too -- have some log level option

(04/Jul/2003)
real sendmail does:
rainier:~$ echo 456 | /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail '"jeremy reed"@localhost'
"jeremy reed"@localhost... User unknown
/home/reed/dead.letter... Saved message in /home/reed/dead.letter

(11/Jun/2003)
improve logging -- it doesn't even log message for each recipient
  or maybe that doesn't matter?

(11/Jun/2003)
maybe don't need dot_added in message.c??

(11/Jun/2003)
make sure CTRL-C during input causes it to cancel and clean up queue
and maybe return an error return code?

is it normal to use strncpy to set a string pointer to a CPP
macro? why not just define it withjout using strncpy?
(this is for myhostname in mailout.c)

(21/Mar/2003)
look at http://www.stafford.uklinux.net/libesmtp/  but it is GPL'd

(20/Mar/2003)
Brackets are indeed required in the MAIL and RCPT commands,
be sure to require them or use them

(11/Mar/2003)
test  -f ""  to specify the empty envelope sender
or
-f <>

(05/Feb/2003)
make sure queues are created O_CREAT+O_EXCL (look at mktemp)

(08/Jan/2003)
test or implement support for real email addresses like
reed (Reminder Service)
(where parenthesis is comment)
(04/Jul/2003) or maybe this doesn't matter; it appears that
this is now obsolete in RFC2822

(05/Dec/2002)
 -bd should return error!

(25/Nov/2002)
look at http://www.acme.com/software/mini_sendmail/

(25/Nov/2002)
fsync the files

(12/Nov/2002)
some mta's (like qmail) don't crop out BCC fields.

(22/Oct/2002)
make sure mail is not lost on kill, ctrl-c or whatever

(22/Oct/2002)
start -devel, announce, and user (discussion) mailing lists

(26/Aug/2002)
after checking basic syntax, maybe fork and exit so it returns quick

(02/Aug/2002)
when sending to many recipients with one bad "kib2kibservices.net"
 then it doesn't mail to any. Try to mail to ones that work
 and record the ones that don't for queue.

(02/Aug/2002)
when should a hostname be added to recipient username??
so maybe add "@hostname" if needed

(18/Jul/2002)
if it can't send then reply a bounce message back
$ echo "test" | sendmail bogus@reedmedia.net
mailout: remote smtp didn't like RCPT TO: Undefined error: 0
mailout: remote smtp didn't like DATA command: No message of desired type
** This above was wrong -- it is just in queue
$ echo "test" | /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail bogus@reedmedia.net
$
** this sent bounce and removed from queue

queue files don't have recipients listed!

have switch or compile option or config that allows setting hostname (10/Jul/2002)

make sure I properly handle smtp return codes: (12/Apr/2002)
if rcpt_to fails then report in queue data file

look at src/mail/smtpsend.c (29/Jan/2002)

what is this last_buf junk?

if multiple rcpt to:'s then check for okay and figure out what to do (26/mar/2002)

work with:
sendmail -oi -oem -bm -f <sender> <recipient> <recipient...>
and pipe it the message on standard input.

local deliveries should pipe to sendmail instead of using localhost:25,
unless software is prepared to queue before it gets to local SMTP port.

must work with:
/usr/sbin/sendmail -bs -odb -oem
 This is what pine uses by default (24/Jan/2002)

If From: header just has username (and no @host) then add it! (15/Nov/2001)
 For example with Exim:
From: reed
Reply-To: reed
 became
From: "Jeremy C. Reed" <reed@pilchuck.reedmedia.net>
Reply-To: reed@pilchuck.reedmedia.net

it seems like mail of a big file is faster with mail (11/Oct/2001)
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/stdout bs=1k count=2048 | tr '\0' 'A' | sendmail test@foo.bar

write routine to properly fold long headlines (11/Oct/2001)
 maybe it can return current_line (which will be saved) and
 next_line (which will be added on to)

document: doesn really parse for rfc2822 valid addresses (11/Oct/2001)

don't replace myhostname with HOSTNAME (11/Oct/2001)
 but have a separate variable for appending to email address

add compile time feature to turn off syslogging! (11/Oct/2001)

add username to get rid of "from username@host" in Received header (11/Oct/2001)

warnings (10/Oct/2001):
message.c: In function `make_queue_filenames':
message.c:275: warning: long int format, time_t arg (arg 4)

if no headers and it adds headers, then must send newline (10/Oct/2001)
 Bug noticed with qmail but not with exim.
 Strange that qmail allows invalid header. Still I need to the right thing.
- this read_and_save_message() is all out of order or done wrong
  it shouldn't print data until the it is ready,
  so a CRLF can be added or special headers added

bounce (via Resent-To) does not work! (23/Oct/2001)
 it causes qmail to fail it because it is looping
 I do not know expected behavior -- espcially when To: and Cc:
 headers may exist.

consider adding "-bs" option (23/Oct/2001)
 see Exim manual page

clean up message.c mess (10/Oct/2001)
 for example, it has redundant routines
 maybe have a "write" function that did the checks?

two places that adds missing headers? (10/Oct/2001)
 message.c and smtp.c?
 use the one from the data file because it has the correct info
 (just in case message is sent later because it was queued)

figure out if should reject sending message or queue for later
 depending on temp error 4xx vs. permanent 5xx (10/Oct/2001)

maybe make sure long headers are wrapped with whitespace starting
 new wrapped line(s) (10/Oct/2001)

replace sprintf with snprintf or asprintf (10/Oct/2001)

(03/Oct/2001)
force set size limit for email addresses, etc.

One tab (like exim and sendmail) for each additional line for "Received:" (02/Oct/2001)
 - qmail uses two spaces instead

must use /etc/aliases or /etc/mail/aliases (20/Sep/2001)

have "-v" option (20/Sep/2001)

make sure it does the right thing when mailhub gives error because
 verify failed for SMTP recipient (18/Sep/2001)
 I can test with email that doesn't have an A or MX record.
 currently:
echo "junk" | sendmail reed@somwhere.outsthere.reedmedia.net

mailout: remote smtp didn't like DATA command: No message of desired type

log message ID also (18/Sep/2001)

log problems also (18/Sep/2001)

If no "To:" header then add one using recipient from command line (18/Sep/2001)

headers be like:

what caused /var/cron/m2696-973584000? (23/Jun/2001)

fix so it works as mailq (14/Apr/2001)
 mailout: neither action flags nor mail addresses given.
$ /usr/libexec/sendmail/sendmail -bp
/var/spool/mqueue is empty

mailout setgid mailout group (or user) so it can write to the queues

If disk is full: (13/Jun/2001)
Mail not sent. Sending error: 451 qq write error or disk full (#4.3.0)]

test with smtpstone and postfix load tests (22/May/2001)

make sure "mailq -v" is implemented (02/May/2001)

what does (command-line) sendmail/exim do when you try to relay through
someone that rejects you? Does it bounce? error right then? Will it
queue and try later? (26/Apr/2001)

(10/Aug/2001)
my queue: when will I report back to the sender about problems?
(exim sometimes waits 24 hours)
 when will it give up? (how will the admin choose retry times?)
 -- never runs as a daemon; so cron job must run queue.

make sure it changes "From: reed" to
 "From: Jeremy C. Reed <reed@rainier.reedmedia.net>"
 (24/Apr/2001)

each line sent so smtp must have CRLF
 mailout doesn't work with qmail unless
 sed -e 's/$/^M/'
 http://pobox.com/~djb/docs/smtplf.html
 (23/Apr/2001)

data file has different size:

in getmailserver() in mailout.c need to check sizes first (23/Apr/2001)
 it should still queue mail for trying later

in smtp.c makeconnection() need to report if can't
 resolve hname and then die (23/Apr/2001)
 must still queue for later.

fix mailout so it properly sends headers (no blank

To: root
Subject: Cron <root@rainier> /usr/pkg/bin/rsync -ave ssh --delete

X-Cron-Env: <HOME=/var/log>

X-Cron-Env: <USER=root>


fix so works with cron! (28/Mar/2001)
 /usr/sbin/sendmail -FCronDaemon -odi -oem -oi -or0s -t

Make sure it parses
 -fname
 -Fname
(28/Mar/2001)

add headers (Received:, etc...) (16/Feb/2001)

logging should say each recipient? (16/Feb/2001)

if receive CTRL-C (or other terminate), then properly close logging, data files,
 etc (16/Feb/2001)
